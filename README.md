A problem relevant to Web3 users is remembering which address belongs to who/what and also the context of their historical transactions. W3nPay makes payments easier by mapping the user's connected wallet to all externally owned acccounts it's interacted with, sorted by descending number of interactions in an address book. Users are able to send payments, request payments, and fulfill payment requests directly from their W3npay address book, all while being able to attach meaningful memos that add context to the transactions.
