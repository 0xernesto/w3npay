The problem relevant to Web3 users is remembering which address belongs to who/what and
also the context of thier historical transactions. W3nPay makes money easier for everyone
by mapping an indicated user's wallet to externally owned acccounts sorted by descending
number of interactions in an address book. Users of W3nPay are able to complete transactions
to or from web3 addresses and attach memos to them, all remembered by W3nPay. W3nPay scales
with the increase of web3 wallet users making transactions across the globe.
